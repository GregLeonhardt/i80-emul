This is just one of many other Intel 8080 emulation programs for linux.  As you might guess, I didn't write it because the others are trash, (e expect they are as good or better), but rather I just simply wanted to do it.

I had intentions to do (actually started as) a Zilog Z80 emulations.  But, after getting the base Intel instructions running and getting CP/M up and running I more or less lost intrest in the whole thing.

A couple things of intrest:

The emulator is fully capable of running as an Intel 8080 or a Zilog Z80 (if the instruction set is ever complete)

Processor emulation mode can be changed on the fly.

Intel 8080 and Zilog Z80 flags are generated per the processor manual.  The main differences being the DAA instruction and the parity flag.
  
With CP/M running disks may be mounted and dismounted through the imbedded command cprcessor activated by pressing the 'F1' key.
